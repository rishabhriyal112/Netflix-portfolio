        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          As a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Swami Rama Himalayan University, 
          I'm passionate about the intersection of web development and machine learning. 
          My journey has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create solutions that make a real impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently interning at CareHive Pvt Ltd, I'm gaining hands-on experience in system architecture and API design. 
          I love building user-friendly web applications and developing deep learning models that can solve 
          real-world problems in healthcare and agriculture.
